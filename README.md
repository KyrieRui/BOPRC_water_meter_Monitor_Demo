BOPRC has a large amount of water meter data, much of which is manually entered into Excel by employees who first take pictures with their cell phones and then manually enter all the collected data into Excel.
This process would save BOPRC a lot of labor costs if they could use AI, perform image recognition, and then add automated office work.

This website demo is a vision of integrating GPT in the front-end webpage and employees uploading images to Chat Bot on the right side while data recognition is performed.
When the text message is recognized, the employee chooses to enter the information into the backend database.
Also on the left side of the webpage is the ability to visualize the books in the database.

## The following is the demo of the website
